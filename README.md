# **M**ultiphysics-informed **D**esign of **T**unable **S**mart **M**aterials

This is an application repository with a collection of drivers for the simulation of Thermo-Electro-Magneto-Mechanical problems. It is based on [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl), a package for grid-based approximation of PDEs with Finite Element.

## Usage
First, include the main HyperFEM module:
```julia
using HyperFEM
```
